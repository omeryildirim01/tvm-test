Q1 , Q2, Q3 tests added. each class performs one of tests.
Q1
Write a function that sorts a bunch of words by the number of character “a”s within the word (decreasing
order). If some words contain the same amount of character “a”s then you need to sort those words by their
lengths.
Input:
["aaaasd", "a", "aab", "aaabcd", "ef", "cssssssd", "fdz", "kf", "zc",
"lklklklklklklklkl", "l"]
Output :
["aaaasd", "aaabcd", "aab", "a", "lklklklklklklklkl", "cssssssd", "fdz",
"ef", "kf", "zc", "l"]
Q2
Write a recursive function which takes one integer parameter. Please bearin mind that finding the algorithm
needed to generate the output below is the main point of the question.
Input:
9
Output :
2
4
9
Q3
Write a function which takes one parameter as an array/list. Find mostrepeated data within given array. Test
with different datasets.
